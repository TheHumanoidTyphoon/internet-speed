Internet Speed Tester
This script tests your internet speed by running a series of speed tests and measuring the download and upload speeds, ping time, latency, jitter, and packet loss. The results are plotted and saved to a CSV or JSON file.

Getting started
To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website.

You'll also need to install the following packages:

speedtest-cli
matplotlib
You can install these packages using pip:
pip install speedtest-cli matplotlib

Usage
To run the script, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script. Then run the following command:
python speedtest.py [num_tests] [output_file]

where num_tests is the number of speed tests to run (default is 3) and output_file is the name of the output file to save the results to (optional).

For example, to run 5 speed tests and save the results to a CSV file called results.csv, run the following command:
python speedtest.py 5 results.csv

Output
The script will output the results of each speed test to the console, as well as the average download speed, upload speed, ping time, latency, jitter, and packet loss. If multiple tests are run, the standard deviation of the download speeds will also be calculated and displayed.

The script will also plot the download and upload speeds over time, and save the results to a CSV or JSON file, depending on the file extension specified.
